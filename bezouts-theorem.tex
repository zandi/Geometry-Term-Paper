\section{Bezout's Theorem}
Bezout's theorem will be important later, but we
probably won't be able to fully prove it here. However,
the book does prove the limited cases that we'll most rely on.

\begin{theorem}
\emph{Bezout's Theorem}:\\

If $C$ and $D$ are plane curves of degree $m$ and $n$ (respectively)
then $C \cap D$ contains precisely $mn$ points, provided:
\begin{align*}
&\text{The field we're working over is algebraically closed} \tag{i}\\
&\text{Points of intersection are counted with multiplicity} \tag{ii}\\
&\text{We work in $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ to account for points at infinity} \tag{iii}\\
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

Instead of proving the general theorem, we'll only cover a special 
case of particular importance to us; intersections involving
lines and conics.

\begin{theorem}
Let $L \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$ be a line (respectively, $C \subset \mathbb{P}^2_K$ a non-degenerate conic)
and $D \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$ a curve defined by $D:(G_d(X,Y,Z)=0)$ where $G$ is
a form of degree $d$ in the 3 variables $X,Y,Z$. Also, assume that $L \not\subset D$ (resp. $C \not\subset D$).
Then
\[
|L \cap D| \le d
\]
and respectively
\[
|C \cap D| \le 2d
\]
And in fact, once accounting for multiplicity, points at infinity, and if $k$ is algebraically
closed, we have equality.
\end{theorem}
