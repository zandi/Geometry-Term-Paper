\section{Elliptic Curves}

One of the more interesting sections. Definitely need to
cover proving the given construction on the non-singuler elliptic
curve creates a group. Should also cover how in practice for crypto
the identity is chosen as the point at infinity, allowing for 
much cheaper computation.

Current strategy is to develop this section, then determine
dependencies for understanding, and stuff those in the
earlier sections.

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:ellipticgroup}
\emph{Group Law on a Plane Cubic:}
Suppose $k \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$,
and $F \in k[X,Y,Z]$ is a cubic form defining a non-empty plane
curve $\mathfrak{C}:(F=0) \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$. Additionally, assume that
$F$ satisfies the following:
\begin{align*}
F \text{ is irreducible, so $\mathfrak{C}$ won't contain a line or conic}&\tag{a}\\
\forall P \in \mathfrak{C},~\exists!~line~L \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k~s.t.~ P
\text{ is a repeated zero of } F|_L& \tag{b}\\
\end{align*}

Now, fix any point $O \in \mathfrak{C}$ and make the following construction:
\begin{align*}
&\text{for } A \in \mathfrak{C}, \text{ let } \bar{A} \text{ be the third point of intersection of $\mathfrak{C}$ with $\overleftrightarrow{OA}$} \tag{i}\\
&\text{for } A, B \in \mathfrak{C} \text{ let } R \text{ be the third point of intersection of $\mathfrak{C}$ with $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$}\\
&\text{ and define $A+B = \bar{R}$}\tag{ii}\\
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

Geometrically, the uniqueness in (b) says that $\mathfrak{C}$ should be non-singular,
and we can see that this line $L$ is in fact the tangent line to $\mathfrak{C}$ at $P$.
Likewise, (a) prevents somewhat degenerate cases.

As you may have noticed, we've defined an operation on points of this
cubic curve $\mathfrak{C}$, so naturally we're curious what sort of structure then
arises. It turns out that this actually defines an Abelian Group on $\mathfrak{C}$,
as we will now prove.

\begin{theorem}
The above construction (Definition \ref{def:ellipticgroup}) defines
an Abelian Group $(\mathfrak{C},+)$ with $O$ as the identity element.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Well, to prove this is an abelian group, we have a few conditions we must satisfy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Well-definedness of the operation and inverses
\item Existence of an identity element
\item Existence of unique inverses
\item Commutativity
\item Associativity
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Well-Definedness:}\\
Let $P, Q \in \mathfrak{C}$. Then, we have two simple cases:\\

case 1:  $P \ne Q$. Then $\exists! L \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$ such that $L = \overleftrightarrow{PQ}$.\\

case 2: $P = Q$. Then, part (b) of the definition gives that $\exists! L \subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$ such that
$P$ is a repeated root of $F|_L$.\\

Note, however, that in both cases $F|_L$ is a cubic form in 2 variables.
So, as $F|_L$ is a 3rd degree form, it has precisely 3 roots, 2 of which
are the $k$-valued points $P$ and $Q$. Well, $P \in \mathbb{P}^2_k,~Q\in \mathbb{P}^2_k$,
so $F|_L$ is the product of 3 linear terms from $k[X,Y,Z]$. Thus, the
third root of $F|_L$ is certainly defined, and must also be from $\mathbb{P}^2_k$, and of course from $\mathfrak{C}$.

So, given any two points on $\mathfrak{C}$, the line they determine intersects $\mathfrak{C}$ at some third point.
Thus our construction, which relies on such a third point existing, is well defined. That is,
Given any $A \in \mathfrak{C},~\bar{A}$ is a unique element of $\mathfrak{C}$, and given any $A, B \in \mathfrak{C},~A+B$ 
is a unique point of $\mathfrak{C}$.\\

\emph{Commutativity:}\\
Well, need to show that $A+B = B+A$. Miles Reid chooses to ``leave this to the reader", 
and likewise we won't elaborate on this. Simply note that $\overleftrightarrow{AB} = \overleftrightarrow{BA}$,
so they share the same 3rd point of intersection with $\mathfrak{C}$.\\

\emph{Identity:}\\
Let $A \in \mathfrak{C}$ be some arbitrary point of $\mathfrak{C}$, and consider $O+A$.
Well, by our construction, we first find the third point
of intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{OA}$ with $\mathfrak{C}$, which by (i)
is $\bar{A}$. From here, to find $O+A$ we must now find the
third point of intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{O\bar{A}}$ with $\mathfrak{C}$. However, note
that $O,~A,~\bar{A}$ are all collinear. Thus, this third point
of intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{O\bar{A}}$ with $\mathfrak{C}$ is $A$. Hence, $O+A=A,~\forall A \in \mathfrak{C}$.\\

\emph{Inverses:}\\
Let $L$ be the line tanget to $\mathfrak{C}$ at $O$. That is, $L$ is the unique line s.t.
$F|_L$ has $O$ as a repeated zero. Now, let $\bar{O}$ be the 3rd root of $F|_L$.
Now, given any point $A \in \mathfrak{C}$, we can see that the third point of intersection
of $\overleftrightarrow{A\bar{O}}$ with $\mathfrak{C}$ is the inverse of $A$.

Call this third point of intersection $A'$. Now, consider $A+A'$. By definition,
$A,~A',~\bar{O}$ are all collinear, so the third point of intersection of 
$\overleftrightarrow{AA'}$ with $\mathfrak{C}$ is $\bar{O}$. Now, by how we defined
$\bar{O}$, we know that the third point of intersection of $\mathfrak{C}$ with $\overleftrightarrow{O\bar{O}}$
is $O$, as $O$ is a repeated root of this line. Thus, $A+A' = O$, so in the
future we'll refer to such an $A'$ as $A^{-1}$.

Finally, note that as $A^{-1}$ was picked as the third point of intersection of
$\mathfrak{C}$ with $\overleftrightarrow{A\bar{O}}$, it is well-defined.\\

\emph{Associativity:}\\
Associativity is by far the most difficult part of this proof. We'll first prove 
Associativity for one case, and then reduce the general case to this special case.\\

Suppose that $A,B,C \in \mathfrak{C}$. We want to show that $(A+B)+C = A+(B+C)$.
Well, in the construction of $(A+B)+C$ we use the 4 lines
\[
L_1: \overleftrightarrow{ABR},~L_2: \overleftrightarrow{RO\bar{R}},~L_3: \overleftrightarrow{C\bar{R}S},~L_4: \overleftrightarrow{SO\bar{S}}
\]
Likewise, the construction of $A+(B+C)$ involves
\[
M_1: \overleftrightarrow{BCQ},~M_2: \overleftrightarrow{QO\bar{Q}},~M_3: \overleftrightarrow{A\bar{Q}S'},~M_4: \overleftrightarrow{S'O\bar{S'}}
\]

Clearly, $(A+B)+C = A+(B+C) \iff \bar{S}=\bar{S'} \iff S=S'$. We'll prove $S=S'$ by inspecting the two cubics
\[
	D_1 = L_1 + M_2 + L_3 \text{ and } D_2 = M_1 + L_2 + M_3
\]
\end{proof}
