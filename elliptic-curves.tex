\section{Elliptic Curves}

One of the more interesting sections. Definitely need to
cover proving the given construction on the non-singuler elliptic
curve creates a group. Should also cover how in practice for crypto
the identity is chosen as the point at infinity, allowing for 
much cheaper computation.
