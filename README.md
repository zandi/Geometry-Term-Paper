Geometry-Term-Paper
===================

Undergraduate-level term paper on Algebraic Geometry.

My undergraduate geometry course required a term paper on some
geometry-related topic, so I chose Algebraic Geometry. This
paper should serve as an approachable though shallow peek
at Algebraic Geometry, suitable for an undergraduate math
major.

Building
===================

To build, simply run 'make'. The default target will use
pdflatex to build the final pdf.
